* Day 14
* Uploaded cryptor.py - a first draft of the text editor that encrypts and decrypts text

* Day 8
* Merged previous repos into this one

# body_encrypt
A combination of the text editor and the encryption repo

# messenger.py
A basic text editor made with tkinter in python 3.8.1

The eventual goal of this project is to turn the editor into a file encrypter/decrypter, a way to make a secure one-time scratchpad. There are other programs that can do this well, I just wanted to learn how.
Right now it's nothing fancy, but this was uploaded on my Day 3 of 100 Days of Code as I learn what I need to do to make this happen.

# encrypt.py
Key generation and string encryption
* Generates a key
* Takes a string from input
* Converts the string into bytes
* Encrypts the bytes
* Prints the ciphertext
* Prints the decrypted string
* Prints the key that was generated
