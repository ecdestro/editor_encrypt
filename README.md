# Messenger - A learner's attempt at string encryption with passwords

This project is my 100 Days Of Code challenge for myself to develop an app that works much the same way that a simple text editor does, only that it encrypts the data it saves with a password that the author chooses, and decrypts it with that same password.

* messenger2.py is the first version of this project's goal. This was completed on day 14 and serves as a skeleton to base further versions on.
* The next feature to implement is to delete the message file open successfully opening. I'm unsure yet how to accomplish this as giving the wrong password does not throw an error. That will be this week's project.
